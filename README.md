## About

Viscuit is an visual programming language. It is primarly aimed for used in education with kids.

- It was created 2003
- Create a program by teaching a computer how to change (move) a picture using a part called "glasses".

> The background to the birth of biscuits is that in the current popular programming introductory languages, programming is too focused and it is difficult to understand the "essence of computers". For example, block-based visual programming languages ​​such as Scratch and programming have been taken to make it easier to get closer to today's mainstream programming languages.

> Biscuits are not an introductory language for programming, but for intuitive understanding that "computers are like this". By using biscuits with excitement and programming while having fun (without knowing it), you naturally develop your intuition for computers.

>Since 2003, biscuits have been used in various situations such as educational institutions, exhibition facilities, and events.
